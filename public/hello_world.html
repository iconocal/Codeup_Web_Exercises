			George: You can't have a relationship where one person says 'I love you,' and the other one says 'I'm hungry, let's get something to eat. Jerry: That's the true spirit of Christmas; people being helped by people other than me.

			Jerry: I'm not an orgy guy. George: I love a good nap. Sometimes it's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. Jackie Chiles: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn’t tell you to put the balm on. Why’d you put the balm on.

				<strong>Jerry: So, um, do you date immature men?</strong>

			Jerry: It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. Jerry: I wonder if illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup. Jerry: You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you’ve pretty much mapped out his future? Jerry: Breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can't do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times! Jackie Chiles: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn’t tell you to put the balm on. Why’d you put the balm on?

			Jerry: Did the medical journal mention anything about standing in a pool of somebody else's urine. Kenny Bania: Hey, Jerry, did you see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed. George [visiting a mental institution]: I should be in a place like this. George: I don't trust men in capes. Jerry: There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character. Jerry: That must've been one magic loogie. Jerry: You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves; you've pretty much mapped out his future. By the way, celebrates its second birthday today! That's very nice of you to notice. Thank you.

			You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
