		<p>George: You can't have a relationship where one person says 'I love you,' and the other one says 'I'm hungry, let's get something to eat. Jerry: That's the true spirit of Christmas; people being helped by people other than me.</p>

		<p>Jerry: I'm not an orgy guy. George: I love a good nap. Sometimes it's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. Jackie Chiles: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn’t tell you to put the balm on. Why’d you put the balm on. Jerry: So, um, do you date immature men? Jerry: It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. Jerry: I wonder if illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup. Jerry: You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you’ve pretty much mapped out his future? Jerry: Breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can't do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times! Jackie Chiles: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn’t tell you to put the balm on. Why’d you put the balm on?</p>

		<p>Jerry: Did the medical journal mention anything about standing in a pool of somebody else's urine. Kenny Bania: Hey, Jerry, did you see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed. George [visiting a mental institution]: I should be in a place like this. George: I don't trust men in capes. Jerry: There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character. Jerry: That must've been one magic loogie. Jerry: You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves; you've pretty much mapped out his future. By the way, celebrates its second birthday today! That's very nice of you to notice. Thank you.</p>
