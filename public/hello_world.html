			Hi, I'm Calvin and this is my Rocking Web Page O' Fun! I can only imagine the excitement you must be feeling right now. Take a moment to compose yourself and get a handle on the moment. Try to acheive some kind of equilibrium because, trust me, it's only going to get MORE EXCITING
			as you get further in and learn more about me! My childhood, for example, was particularly fascinating. Oh, the stories that await you...

			No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.

	<h2>Here's the First Picture Ever Posted on the Web</h2>

	<img src="/img/firstone.jpg" alt="the first web picture">

	<p>"The lovely ladies in the photo were part of a musical group called Les Horrible Cernettes, a comedy band based at the CERN laboratory in Geneva which was comprised of admin assistants and significant others of CERN scientists. The photo was tweaked in version one of Photoshop on a color Mac and saved as a .gif before being uploaded by Tim Berners-Lee, one of the inventors of the Internet... and a crossdresser. Yeah, it gets a little weird."</p>
