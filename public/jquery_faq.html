			<dt>What's a National Park?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">Seriously? What a bonehead.</dd>
			<dt>You didn't answer my question.</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">My mind is still reeling from how stupid your question is.</dd>
			<dt>Ok, jerkface. There's no need to be rude about it. I googled it and got an answer.</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">Good idea. From now on Google all of your stupid questions and only come to me with questions that won't result in my staring at you with disgust and contempt.</dd>
			<dt>Hey, what is wrong with you anyway?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">I'm quickly becoming weary of this.</dd>
			<dt>Look. Can we just start over?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">Yeepah! Yeepah!</dd>
			<dt>I'll take that as a yes. Have you ever been to a National Park?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">My grandfather used to drag me and my sister to all sorts of National Parks.</dd>
			<dt>Did you enjoy it?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">Once my grandfather bought me a toy bow and arrow set. I shot my sister with it. I enjoyed that.</dd>
			<dt>What?? Was she hurt?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">Nah. I mean, not physically. She still carries the emotional scars.</dd>
			<dt>Emotional scars?</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">Yeah. Emotional scars. To this day the sound of drums makes her cry. Or if you point a bow and arrow at her.</dd>
			<dt>Ha! That sounds pretty funny!</dt>
			<dd class="invisible red">It is. It really is.</dd>
